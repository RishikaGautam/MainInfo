      What are Coral Reefs?  
    </p>
    <h3><br>
            Corals are fascinating animals who belong to a species known as Cnidaria. 
            Other animals in this species are jellyfish and sea anemones! Reefs are made up of tiny organisms known as polyps. 
            Polyps are extremely soft so they take Calcium from the sea to produce hard limestone skeletons for support. 
            These polyps come together as a colony and build on each other, eventually acting as one organism, forming reefs.
            They live and grow while being connected to each other. Isn’t it fascinating?

      Why are Coral Reefs Important?  
    </p>
    <h3><br>
        The whole world relies on reefs, whose benefits are valued at about $9.8 trillion each year!
        Though they cover only 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to almost 25% of all ocean species! This includes a variety of plants, fish, whales etc. 
        Additionally, reefs provide a home, act as a breeding ground, and protect many fish species from dangerous predators. 
        Did you know that Nemo from ‘Finding Nemo’ also lived in a reef? If reefs didn’t exist, he wouldn’t have a home, a safety net or any family and friends.
        <br>
        Reefs directly and indirectly provide over one billion people all over the world with food. 
        On one hand people can directly fish from reefs to get the seafood they need. 
        On the other hand, reefs are home to a lot of important organisms in marine food webs. 
        If these organisms died, fish all over the world would be affected. 
        For example, seahorses eat krill found in coral reefs and the krill eat algae growing in the reef. 
        If the reef died out, the krill would starve, causing the seahorses to starve, and the cycle continues.
        <br>
        Reefs are also natural barriers against dangers from the sea. 
        They absorb a lot of forceful waves and storm surges, protecting many communities. 
        Without them, these communities would be far more vulnerable to natural disasters and be
        forced to rely on man made sea walls to keep them safe which are not nearly as effective. 
        <br>
        Overall, Reefs provide economical, societal and natural benefits, so we should ensure that they are protected and safe.

        What is Coral Bleaching? Why is this a problem?
    </p>
    <h3><br>
        Before understanding what coral bleaching is, it is important to know a little bit more about coral.
        Corals have a collaborative relationship with these microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. 
        These algae feed the coral, remove waste from their system, and give them their bright colors while the corals provide the 
        algae with nutrients that help them survive.  This mutually beneficial relationship makes it so that the corals and algae can’t live without each other.
        <br>
        Coral Bleaching occurs when the algae is forced to leave the coral due to things like increases in ocean temperatures, toxic chemicals, and too much sunlight, 
        making the coral lose its color and starve to death. A little bit of bleaching in reefs is perfectly normal, especially in summers where the temperatures are 
        higher. However, as climate change worsens, so does coral bleaching. For instance, ocean temperatures are rapidly rising due to climate change, causing marine 
        heatwaves that bring about bleaching events throughout the world. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, between 2014 and 2017 around
        75% of the world’s tropical coral reefs experienced heat-stress severe enough to trigger bleaching. For 30% of the world’s reefs, that heat-stress was
        enough to kill coral.
        <br>
        <br>
        Examples of such events:

            - 2005: The U.S.A lost half of its reefs in the caribbean in one year (maybe add pic)
            - 2014: Florida lost ⅓ of their Elkhorn Corals to a bleaching event
            - 2015-16: The Pacific Remote Islands lost a significant number of their reefs to an ocean heat wave caused by El Nino
            - 2016: 22% of corals in the Great Barrier Reef died because of the same heatwave
